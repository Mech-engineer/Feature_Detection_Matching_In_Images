# This is Feature Detection and Matching Repository

The Jupyter notebook in this repository is built using OpenCV library.

For the given stereo images we use multiple feature detection method to implement featuere detection and matching techniques.

An outlier rejection was also implemented to pick the top featuers considering the camera has epipolar constraint.
